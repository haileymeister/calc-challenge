# Hailey Meister's Calculator App

This project impliments a simple calculator with React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The site is hosted with github pages and the database is set up through Firebase. Unfortunatly the capabilities of my database do not allow me to change the order of the data because of the randomly generated keys so equations end up in a random order even the most recent.

## Using My Calculator

To use my calculator you type in an equation with no spaces like `1+2` then press evaluate. Because of the database ordering the answer may or may not show up in the previous problems section.
